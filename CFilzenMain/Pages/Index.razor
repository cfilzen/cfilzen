<h1>Chris Filzen</h1>


<div class="text-body">
Welcome to my new playground. I live in Sarasota Florida. I am married with 5 kids and 2 grandkids.
I love to fish and hunt. I also ride motorcycles. I have been a software engineer for around 25 years.
I specialize in backend services. But I have quite a bit of experience with frontend companents as well.
I have programmed using C# throughout the majority of my career, with the exception of the first 2 or 3 years;
only because C# wasn't a thing yet. My first project was actually using Java and Java Applets back in the mid-90's.
I love a good challenge, which proves to be a daily part of a developer's life. I enjoy working with others. I feel
others help me grow as a developer. You never know when you are working with a team member and see there is a better
way.
